A (hopefully) useful tool for teachers

## Objective

I wanted to create a tool for teachers to generate math worksheets. My primary goal was to make this functional and present the tool with a nice user interface. Many of the tools I found online were cluttered with advertisements and requirements to provide an email address before receiving the worksheet.

## Use

This application is currently hosted on Heroku. You can access it [here](https://teacher-toolkit.herokuapp.com/).

Right now this is a single page which dynamically generates a PDF that you can download. In the immediate future I plan on improving the ability to create useful one-step equations and add new configuration options. After that I may include other other common math worksheets.

**Current Iteration**

## Feedback and Contributions

As time goes on, I would like to improve this and provide more functionality. If you have any recommendations please feel free to submit a new issue on this repository. I'll do my best to respond to it as soon as I can.

You're welcome to create a pull request if you would like. I'll be happy to review it and see if there's a place for it in this project.
