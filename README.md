A (hopefully) useful tool for teachers

## Todo

- Complete this README
- Close open issue regarding PDF generation
- Begin writing tests to guide further development
- Correct link for reporting issues
- Buy domain name
- Host a simple page to describe to submit bugs / feedback
- I only need to allow users to control the number of equations before this can be considered useful (more or less)
